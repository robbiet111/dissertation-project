%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
    
    This dissertation investigates the development and implementation of HarmonyScape, an inclusive initiative tailored for individuals with intellectual disabilities, including Alzheimer's. Inspired by the profound link between music and cognitive function, HarmonyScape creates a captivating 3D world where music dynamically responds to user exploration. Through character control in an open-world setting and interactive music-based mini games, players unlock new instruments, filling out the games' musical landscape. The project's aim is to provide a multi-sensory environment that potentially aids cognitive well-being while offering an engaging, interactive experience. Initial user feedback indicates high levels of engagement and enjoyment, suggesting promising avenues for inclusive gaming and therapeutic interventions. This research underscores the significance of tailored approaches to accessibility and engagement in fostering cognitive well-being among individuals with intellectual disabilities.

    \textbf{Inclusive 3D Exploration with Music for Intellectual Disabilities}

 

    Imagine an inclusive initiative tailored specifically for individuals with intellectual disabilities, including conditions like Alzheimer's. Through Unity, we plan to create a captivating 3D world that generates music in response to exploration. This project is inspired by the unique relationship between music and cognitive function (Baird \& Samson, 2015), and its therapeutic potential for those with dementia (Vink et al., 2003). By immersing users in a visually engaging environment where music dynamically responds to movement, we aim to provide a multisensory experience that not only captivates but also potentially aids cognitive well-being in an enjoyable, interactive manner.

Why should the reader care about what are you doing and what are you actually doing?
\section{Guidance}

\textbf{Motivate} first, then state the general problem clearly. 

\section{Writing guidance}
\subsection{Who is the reader?}

This is the key question for any writing. Your reader:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    is a trained computer scientist: \emph{don't explain basics}.
    \item
    has limited time: \emph{keep on topic}.
    \item
    has no idea why anyone would want to do this: \emph{motivate clearly}
    \item
    might not know \emph{anything} about your project in particular:
    \emph{explain your project}.
    \item
    but might know precise details and check them: \emph{be precise and
    strive for accuracy.}
    \item
    doesn't know or care about you: \emph{personal discussions are
    irrelevant}.
\end{itemize}

Remember, you will be marked by your supervisor and one or more members
of staff. You might also have your project read by a prize-awarding
committee or possibly a future employer. Bear that in mind.

\subsection{References and style guides}
There are many style guides on good English writing. You don't need to
read these, but they will improve how you write.

    \item
    \emph{Style: The Basics of Clarity and Grace} \cite{Wil09} A very popular modern English style guide.
    \item
    \emph{Politics and the English Language} \cite{Orw68}  A famous essay on effective, clear writing in English.
    \item
    \emph{The Elements of Style} \cite{StrWhi07} Outdated, and American, but a classic.
    \item
    \emph{The Sense of Style} \cite{Pin15} Excellent, though quite in-depth.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Citation styles}

\begin{itemize}
\item If you are referring to a reference as a noun, then cite it as: ``\citet{Orw68} discusses the role of language in political thought.''
\item If you are referring implicitly to references, use: ``There are many good books on writing \citep{Orw68, Wil09, Pin15}.''
\end{itemize}

There is a complete guide on good citation practice by Peter Coxhead available here: \url{http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pxc/refs/index.html}.

\section{Alzheimer's disease}
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that can affect memory, thinking skills and behaviour. As of 2024, it is the most common cause of dementia, a group of brain disorders that result in loss of intellectual and social skills that is severe enough to interfere with daily functioning (Li et al., 2024). Alzheimer's typically begins slowly and as the disease progresses, individuals can experience memory loss, confusion, difficulty with language and communication, impaired judgment, and changes in personality (Li et al., 2024). Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but treatments and interventions can manage symptoms and improve quality of life for those affected by the disease.

Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments have been trialed to alleviate symptoms of dementia. Pharmacological treatments, like acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, primarily target cognitive symptoms without altering the progression of the disease.
These treatments have shown minimal effectiveness in easing the behavioral and psychological symptoms linked to these diseases (Dyer et al., 2018).

Conversely, non-pharmacological interventions offer supplementary treatments, presenting diverse strategies to enhance the well-being of individuals with dementia, reduce behavioral incidents, and enhance or maintain their quality of life (Dyer et al., 2018).

\section{Music Therapy}

Music therapy is defined by the World Federation of Music Therapy (2011) as the professional application of musical elements (sound, rhythm, melody, and harmony) by qualified therapists to facilitate communication, relationships, learning, expression, and other therapeutic objectives. It is employed across medical, educational, and everyday settings to optimise quality of life and enhance physical, social, communicative, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual health and well-being.

\emph{Music therapy for people with dementia} by Vink AC \emph{et al.} (2004) discusses music therapy as one potential non-pharmacological treatment for people with different forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer's. Of particular relevance to our aims are the discussions of the distinct varieties of music therapy, Vink AC \emph{et al.} (2004) distinguish two main types of music therapy.
\newline

\textbf{Receptive Music Therapy}
\newline

In receptive music therapy, individuals passively engage with music chosen or performed by the therapist. They may listen to live music, recordings, or the therapist's singing. This form of therapy focuses on the emotional and psychological responses evoked by the music. The therapist selects music tailored to the individual's needs, aiming to stimulate relaxation, emotional expression, or cognitive engagement (Vink AC \emph{et al.} 2004).
\newline

\textbf{Active Music Therapy}
\newline

Active music therapy involves active participation from the individual receiving therapy. This can include playing musical instruments, singing, improvisation, or engaging in structured music activities led by the therapist. Active participation encourages physical movement, cognitive stimulation, social interaction, and self-expression. It empowers individuals to actively engage with music-making processes, fostering a sense of agency and creativity in a therapeutic environment (Vink AC \emph{et al.} 2004).

\section{Related Works}
In my comprehensive review of existing literature, I found a notable absence of multisensory experiences tailored for individuals with intellectual disabilities such as Alzheimer’s that incorporate active music theory within a gaming setting. However, a range of experiences created for both academic and commercial purposes have been introduced with a similar goal as that of HarmonyScape in aiding those with intellectual disabilities, including conditions like Alzheimer’s, in enhancing their cognitive well-being in an enjoyable, interactive manner.

\subsection{AARP Staying Sharp}
AARP Staying Sharp is an online platform provided by AARP (formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons) that offers a variety of brain-training games and activities designed to help individuals maintain cognitive function and mental acuity as they age. These games cover a range of cognitive skills such as memory, attention, problem-solving, and language.

\end{figure}

Although AARP Staying Sharp has great potential in helping individuals maintain cognitive function through its variety of brain-training games and activities, a key downfall is the sole use of uni-sensory stimulation, and so is missing out on the range of potential benefits shown from multisensory treatment in those with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's.

Sánchez et al. (2016) discuss these potential positive effects in comparison to uni-sensory experiences in the treatment of people with severe
dementia. Specifically, they discuss the beneficial impact on anxiety symptoms that comes from stimulating different senses which allows for greater sensory environment control. HarmonyScape aims to capitalise on the principles outlined by Sánchez et al. (2016), offering multisensory engagement that intertwines visual and auditory stimuli.

\section{Minigames}
This section describes the different games that influenced the minigames in HarmonyScape, how they incorporate music theory and how they can be used as an interactive means of exercising cognitive skills for those with Alzheimer's and similar neurodegenerative diseases.

\subsection{Card Matching}
De Siqueira et al. (2017) discusses the advantages of utilising well-known traditional games in the development of games tailored for individuals with intellectual disabilities like Alzheimer's. Since many elderly individuals are likely familiar with the rules of these games, minimal introduction and assistance are required for them to be engaged (De Siqueira et al., 2017). Moreover, for those with Alzheimer's, playing these games can evoke memories of past experiences, such as playing as children or with grandchildren, thus facilitating a personalised approach that enhances engagement and motivation (De Siqueira et al., 2017). By incorporating personalisation, memory training games can be even more effective for Alzheimer's patients (Eichhorn et al., 2018).

This inspired the choice of a Card Matching game where the player must uncover pairs of cards by flipping over face-down cards on the playing field and remembering their positions.

These points apply to the whole dissertation, not just this chapter.



\subsection{Figures}
\emph{Always} refer to figures included, like Figure \ref{fig:relu}, in the body of the text. Include full, explanatory captions and make sure the figures look good on the page.
You may include multiple figures in one float, as in Figure \ref{fig:synthetic}, using \texttt{subcaption}, which is enabled in the template.



% Figures are important. Use them well.

    \caption{In figure captions, explain what the reader is looking at: ``A schematic of the rectifying linear unit, where $a$ is the output amplitude,
    $d$ is a configurable dead-zone, and $Z_j$ is the input signal'', as well as why the reader is looking at this: 
    ``It is notable that there is no activation \emph{at all} below 0, which explains our initial results.'' 
    \textbf{Use vector image formats (.pdf) where possible}. Size figures appropriately, and do not make them over-large or too small to read.

\subsection{Equations}

Equations should be typeset correctly and precisely. Make sure you get parenthesis sizing correct, and punctuate equations correctly 
(the comma is important and goes \textit{inside} the equation block). Explain any symbols used clearly if not defined earlier. 

For example, we might define:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{f}(\xi) = \frac{1}{2}\left[ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{2\pi i x \xi} \right],
\end{equation}    
where $\hat{f}(\xi)$ is the Fourier transform of the time domain signal $f(x)$.

\subsection{Algorithms}
Algorithms can be set using \texttt{algorithm2e}, as in Algorithm \ref{alg:metropolis}.

% NOTE: line ends are denoted by \; in algorithm2e
\begin{algorithm}
    \DontPrintSemicolon
    \KwData{$f_X(x)$, a probability density function returing the density at $x$.\; $\sigma$ a standard deviation specifying the spread of the proposal distribution.\;
    $x_0$, an initial starting condition.}
    \KwResult{$s=[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$, $n$ samples approximately drawn from a distribution with PDF $f_X(x)$.}
    \Begin{
        $s \longleftarrow []$\;
        $p \longleftarrow f_X(x)$\;
        $i \longleftarrow 0$\;
        \While{$i < n$}
        {
            $x^\prime \longleftarrow \mathcal{N}(x, \sigma^2)$\;
            $p^\prime \longleftarrow f_X(x^\prime)$\;
            $a \longleftarrow \frac{p^\prime}{p}$\;
            $r \longleftarrow U(0,1)$\;
            \If{$r<a$}
            {
                $x \longleftarrow x^\prime$\;
                $p \longleftarrow f_X(x)$\;
                $i \longleftarrow i+1$\;
                append $x$ to $s$\;
            }
        }
    }

\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Tables}

If you need to include tables, like Table \ref{tab:operators}, use a tool like https://www.tablesgenerator.com/ to generate the table as it is
extremely tedious otherwise.

\subsection{Code}

Avoid putting large blocks of code in the report (more than a page in one block, for example). Use syntax highlighting if possible, as in Listing \ref{lst:callahan}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python, float, caption={The algorithm for packing the $3\times 3$ outer-totalistic binary CA successor rule into a 
    $16\times 16\times 16\times 16$ 4 bit lookup table, running an equivalent, notionally 16-state $2\times 2$ CA.}, label=lst:callahan]
    def create_callahan_table(rule="b3s23"):
        """Generate the lookup table for the cells."""        
        s_table = np.zeros((16, 16, 16, 16), dtype=np.uint8)
        birth, survive = parse_rule(rule)

        # generate all 16 bit strings
        for iv in range(65536):
            bv = [(iv >> z) & 1 for z in range(16)]
            a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p = bv

            # compute next state of the inner 2x2
            nw = apply_rule(f, a, b, c, e, g, i, j, k)
            ne = apply_rule(g, b, c, d, f, h, j, k, l)
            sw = apply_rule(j, e, f, g, i, k, m, n, o)
            se = apply_rule(k, f, g, h, j, l, n, o, p)

            # compute the index of this 4x4
            nw_code = a | (b << 1) | (e << 2) | (f << 3)
            ne_code = c | (d << 1) | (g << 2) | (h << 3)
            sw_code = i | (j << 1) | (m << 2) | (n << 3)
            se_code = k | (l << 1) | (o << 2) | (p << 3)

            # compute the state for the 2x2
            next_code = nw | (ne << 1) | (sw << 2) | (se << 3)

            # get the 4x4 index, and write into the table
            s_table[nw_code, ne_code, sw_code, se_code] = next_code

        return s_table

\chapter{Evaluation} 
How good is your solution? How well did you solve the general problem, and what evidence do you have to support that?

\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Ask specific questions that address the general problem.
    \item
        Answer them with precise evidence (graphs, numbers, statistical
        analysis, qualitative analysis).
    \item
        Be fair and be scientific.
    \item
        The key thing is to show that you know how to evaluate your work, not
        that your work is the most amazing product ever.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evidence}
Make sure you present your evidence well. Use appropriate visualisations, reporting techniques and statistical analysis, as appropriate.

If you visualise, follow the basic rules, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:boxplot}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Label everything correctly (axis, title, units).
\item Caption thoroughly.
\item Reference in text.
\item \textbf{Include appropriate display of uncertainty (e.g. error bars, Box plot)}
\item Minimize clutter.
\end{itemize}

See the file \texttt{guide\_to\_visualising.pdf} for further information and guidance.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{images/boxplot_finger_distance.pdf}    

    \caption{Average number of fingers detected by the touch sensor at different heights above the surface, averaged over all gestures. Dashed lines indicate
    the true number of fingers present. The Box plots include bootstrapped uncertainty notches for the median. It is clear that the device is biased toward 
    undercounting fingers, particularly at higher $z$ distances.

\chapter{Conclusion}    
Summarise the whole project for a lazy reader who didn't read the rest (e.g. a prize-awarding committee).
\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Summarise briefly and fairly.
    \item
        You should be addressing the general problem you introduced in the
        Introduction.        
    \item
        Include summary of concrete results (``the new compiler ran 2x
        faster'')
    \item
        Indicate what future work could be done, but remember: \textbf{you
        won't get credit for things you haven't done}.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Appendices}

Typical inclusions in the appendices are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Copies of ethics approvals (required if obtained)
\item
  Copies of questionnaires etc. used to gather data from subjects.
\item
  Extensive tables or figures that are too bulky to fit in the main body of
  the report, particularly ones that are repetitive and summarised in the body.

\item Outline of the source code (e.g. directory structure), or other architecture documentation like class diagrams.

\item User manuals, and any guides to starting/running the software.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Don't include your source code in the appendices}. It will be
submitted separately.
