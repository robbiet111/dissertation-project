    \textbf{Inclusive 3D Exploration with Music for Intellectual Disabilities}

 

    Imagine an inclusive initiative tailored specifically for individuals with intellectual disabilities, including conditions like Alzheimer's. Through Unity, we plan to create a captivating 3D world that generates music in response to exploration. This project is inspired by the unique relationship between music and cognitive function (Baird \& Samson, 2015), and its therapeutic potential for those with dementia (Vink et al., 2003). By immersing users in a visually engaging environment where music dynamically responds to movement, we aim to provide a multisensory experience that not only captivates but also potentially aids cognitive well-being in an enjoyable, interactive manner.

TOODO: \begin{itemize}
    \item Fix use of singular and double quotation marks
\end{itemize}


This opening chapter sets the stage for the HarmonyScape project by introducing the motivations and goals that led to its development. The following sections of this paper will explore distinct segments of the project, covering its background, design, implementation, and evaluation.

\section{Motivation}

As the prevalence of dementia increases within our aging population, with the number of older people with dementia in the UK projected to rise by 80\% from almost 885,000 in 2019 to around 1.6 million in 2040 (Wittenberg \emph{et al.,} 2019), the development of effective treatments and engaging activities to manage its symptoms becomes imperative.

The means of music as a form of therapy in the treatment of diseases linked with dementia, such as Alzheimer's, is a unique approach that taps into preserved cognitive and emotional functions in individuals with dementia. Music therapy is defined by the World Federation of Music Therapy (2011) as the professional application of musical elements (sound, rhythm, melody, and harmony) by qualified therapists to facilitate communication, relationships, learning, expression, and other therapeutic objectives. Research by Vink AC \emph{et al.} (2004) highlights the potential of music-based therapeutic interventions to target depressive symptoms in individuals with dementia.


While the potential benefits of game-based activities for cognitive function in dementia are highlighted by Vilkki et al. (2019), combining these approaches in a therapeutic setting has been seldom explored. This suggests a valuable avenue for future research in dementia care.

This combined approach is particularly promising for our aging population. As lifespans increase, so does the prevalence of dementia. However, this generation also coincides with a rise in video game popularity. People who were 14 years old in 1973, the year the first home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey\footnote{https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/16909/Magnavox-Odyssey/}, was released globally, would be 65 today. This being the age where the risk of dementia significantly increases (Chen \emph{et al.,} 2009). This generation's familiarity with games can be leveraged to create engaging and effective therapeutic activities. Despite the clear potential of this promising avenue for leveraging a familiar and potentially engaging activity, it remains largely unexplored.

% - multisensory experiences provide mental and emotional stimulation for those with alzhiemers

% - enjoyment of music is something that doesn't dissipate as dementia progresses

% \section{Aims}
% Considering the motivations outlined above, we will develop a multisensory, interactive 3D exploration game designed to potentially aid cognitive well-being in those with dementia, including diseases like Alzheimer's. This game will prioritise enjoyment and captivation while incorporating active music theory principles, where the soundscape dynamically responds to player movement.

% An evaluation will then be conducted to address the following question:
% Is the project a means of captivating and potentially aiding cognitive well-being in an enjoyable, interactive manner?

% This is a broad and complex question that cannot be definitively answered in a single evaluation, especially at this scale. Thus, we present four key questions to help answer the broader question

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item How intrinsically motivating is the game? Does the multisensory design and interactive music system encourage engagement from the player?
%     \item How pleasant and satisfying is the dynamic music-making system for players? Does it promote a sense of creative control and enjoyment?
%     \item Does the game show potential for aiding cognitive well-being in individuals with dementia?
%     \item Does the game induce any negative effects, such as stress or confusion, which could affect players with dementia?
% \end{itemize}

\section{Objectives and Aims}
This section outlines the overarching aims and key objectives guiding the development and evaluation of the HarmonyScape project. The overarching aims define the project's ultimate vision and desired outcomes. The objectives establish the specific actions and targets in the project's design, implementation, and assessment, serving as essential steps towards achieving these aims.

\subsection{Aims}

Building upon the motivations discussed, this project has two core aims.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a game that has the potential to serve as a music-based therapeutic tool, offering enjoyment and potentially aiding cognitive well-being in individuals living with dementia.
    \item Evaluate the HarmonyScape project as a means of captivating users and potentially aiding cognitive well-being. This evaluation will focus on key questions regarding player engagement, enjoyment, potential benefits, and any potential negative effects.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objectives}

The following objectives have been established, serving as stepping stones toward achieving the aims outlined above.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a game environment that prioritises enjoyment and engagement for potential users living with dementia. This includes visually stimulating elements and sound design tailored for these users.
    \item Develop a system where player movement directly influences the soundtrack of the game, incorporating elements of music theory to promote a sense of creative control for the player.
    \item Integrate music theory concepts into the game's design to facilitate musical expression and creativity, offering opportunities for self-directed musical exploration.
    \item Design and execute an evaluation process to assess the project's effectiveness, addressing both the player experience and potential impact on cognitive well-being.

\section{Understanding Dementia and Cognitive Decline}

Throughout this dissertation, I will use the term 'dementia' as an umbrella term for diseases that cause the decline in cognitive abilities that impacts a person's ability to perform everyday activities, which typically involves problems with memory, thinking, and behavior. Dementia is a progressive condition, meaning symptoms worsen over time. This dissertation will specifically focus on individuals with early to mid-stages of dementia. From this point forward, references to 'those living with dementia' will pertain to individuals within these stages. While there are many causes of dementia, the most common is Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that can affect memory, thinking skills, and behavior. As of 2024, it is the most common cause of dementia, a group of brain disorders that result in the loss of cognitive and social skills that is severe enough to interfere with daily functioning (Li et al., 2024). Alzheimer's typically begins slowly, and as the disease progresses, individuals can experience memory loss, confusion, difficulty with language and communication, impaired judgment, and changes in personality (Li et al., 2024). Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but treatments and interventions can manage symptoms and improve the quality of life for those affected by the disease.

Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments have been trialed to alleviate symptoms of dementia. Pharmacological treatments, like acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, primarily target cognitive symptoms without altering the progression of the disease. These treatments have shown minimal effectiveness in easing the behavioral and psychological symptoms linked to these diseases (Dyer et al., 2018).

Conversely, non-pharmacological interventions offer supplementary treatments, presenting diverse strategies to enhance the well-being of individuals with dementia, reduce behavioral incidents, and enhance or maintain their quality of life (Dyer et al., 2018).

\subsection{Attention impairments}\label{sec:attention}
Attention impairments in Alzheimer’s Disease represent a significant aspect of the cognitive decline observed in affected individuals, despite Alzheimer’s Disease being primarily recognised as a memory disorder (Hennawy et al., 2019).

\subsubsection{Selective Attention}
pertains to the cognitive capacity to focus on a singular stimulus while ignoring surrounding distractions (Chau et al., 2015). Impairments in selective attention exacerbate linearly with Alzheimer’s Disease severity (Chau et al., 2015).

\subsubsection{Sustained Attention} is differentiated from other classes of attention by the duration of the required activity (Fortenbaugh et al., 2017). More specifically, sustained attention is defined as the capacity to sustain focus on a particular task over an extended duration (Fortenbaugh et al., 2017).

\subsection{Neuroplasticity}\label{sec:neuroplasticity}
Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt and modify its structure and function throughout life (Costandi, 2016). This includes the formation of new neural connections, the strengthening of existing ones, and even rewiring itself in response to experiences and learning (Costandi, 2016). For people living with dementia, this process is disrupted, leading to the degeneration of brain cells and connections, ultimately causing cognitive decline (Koch and Spampinato, 2022).

Research by Hill, Kolanowski, and Gill (2011) has shown that utilising remaining brain plasticity is a promising avenue for potentially slowing down the progression of dementia. This residual neuroplasticity offers a window of opportunity for non-pharmacological interventions designed to stimulate cognitive function, which can improve spatial awareness and memory in those with dementia (Boggio et al., 2011).

% Music therapy is defined by the World Federation of Music Therapy (2011) as the professional application of musical elements (sound, rhythm, melody, and harmony) by qualified therapists to facilitate communication, relationships, learning, expression, and other therapeutic objectives. It is employed across medical, educational, and everyday settings to optimise quality of life and enhance physical, social, communicative, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual health and well-being.

% \emph{Music therapy for people with dementia} by Vink AC \emph{et al.} (2004) discusses music therapy as one potential non-pharmacological treatment for people with different forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer's. Of particular relevance to our aims are the discussions of the distinct varieties of music therapy, Vink AC \emph{et al.} (2004) distinguish two main types of music therapy.
% \newline

% \textbf{Receptive Music Therapy}

% In receptive music therapy, individuals passively engage with music chosen or performed by the therapist. They may listen to live music, recordings, or the therapist's singing. This form of therapy focuses on the emotional and psychological responses evoked by the music. The therapist selects music tailored to the individual's needs, aiming to stimulate relaxation, emotional expression, or cognitive engagement (Vink AC \emph{et al.} 2004).
% \newline

% \textbf{Active Music Therapy}

% Active music therapy involves active participation from the individual receiving therapy. This can include playing musical instruments, singing, improvisation, or engaging in structured music activities led by the therapist. Active participation encourages physical movement, cognitive stimulation, social interaction, and self-expression. It empowers individuals to actively engage with music-making processes, fostering a sense of agency and creativity in a therapeutic environment (Vink AC \emph{et al.} 2004).

\section{Therapeutic Interventions for Dementia}
This section explores non-pharmacological therapies designed to mitigate the effects of dementia and enhance the quality of life for those affected. We'll begin by examining music therapy, followed by other cognitive stimulation strategies.

\subsection{Music Therapy}\label{sec:music_therapy}

Music therapy is a non-pharmacological intervention that strategically utilises the elements of music (sound, rhythm, melody, and harmony) to enhance the quality of life for individuals whose lives have been impacted by injury, illness, or disability (Bleibel et al., 2023). Qualified therapists tailor music therapy sessions to address various therapeutic goals, including improving communication, social skills, emotional well-being, and cognitive function (Vink AC et al., 2004). Two primary approaches exist within music therapy:

\subsubsection{Receptive Music Therapy:} Individuals passively engage with music chosen or performed by the therapist. The focus is on the emotional and psychological responses evoked by the music, which can promote relaxation, stimulate emotions, and enhance cognitive engagement (Vink AC et al., 2004).

\subsubsection{Active Music Therapy:} Individuals actively participate in musical activities like playing instruments, singing, or improvisation.  This approach fosters physical movement, social interaction, cognitive stimulation, creativity, and self-expression (Vink AC et al., 2004).

Active music therapy offers a particularly promising avenue for improving cognitive function in individuals living with dementia. Research suggests that this direct participation activates brain regions involved in auditory processing, motor control, and emotional regulation (Bleibel et al., 2023). This multi-faceted stimulation may help preserve and strengthen neural pathways involved in memory, attention, language, and other essential cognitive processes impacted by dementia (Bleibel et al., 2023).  Furthermore, active music therapy often a sense of creative expression, further supporting cognitive health and well-being in those with dementia (Bleibel et al., 2023).

\subsection{Cognitive Stimulation}
This section explores the impact of dementia on cognitive function, and introduces strategies for cognitive stimulation, including traditional games and spatial puzzles.

\subsubsection{Familiarity and Engagement in Traditional Games:}\label{sec:traditional_games}
De Siqueira et al. (2017) discusses the advantages of utilising well-known traditional games in the development of games tailored for individuals with intellectual disabilities like Alzheimer's. Since many elderly individuals are likely familiar with the rules of these games, minimal introduction and assistance are required for them to be engaged (De Siqueira et al., 2017). Moreover, for those with Alzheimer's, playing these games can evoke memories of past experiences, such as playing as children or with grandchildren, thus facilitating a personalised approach that enhances engagement and motivation (De Siqueira et al., 2017). By incorporating personalisation, memory training games can be even more effective for Alzheimer's patients (Eichhorn et al., 2018). \newline


\subsubsection{Traditional Sliding Puzzles in the Treatment of Dementia:}\label{sec:sliding_dementia}

Sasaki et al. (2020) explored the use of sliding puzzle's in the treatment of dementia with their brain training application. This is where the user manipulates the panel within a single frame, utilising available space to organise it according to the desired arrangement (Sasaki et al., 2020). The act of sliding the puzzle pieces activates the frontal lobe, responsible for memory, as the user anticipates the direction in which the moving panels can be adjusted to achieve the desired order (Hirono et al., 1997). The user is required to alter the positions of the panels within the sliding block puzzle while retaining the original layout in memory (Sasaki et al., 2020).

The spatial recognition capacity of the frontal lobe is engaged as the user formulates the steps necessary to reach the correct solution by comprehending the panel positions (Hirono et al., 1997). Completing the puzzle requires players to retain memory, arrange figures, and comprehend spatial relationships. This combination of cognitive skills may have the potential to slow dementia progression, as suggested by research from Sasaki et al. (2020). \newline


\subsubsection{Auditory and Spatial Games:}
One promising means for utilising neuroplasticity is through games specifically designed to challenge auditory processing and spatial awareness. These games can provide a stimulating environment that promotes:

Formation of new neural connections: By engaging in novel tasks that challenge auditory processing and spatial reasoning, the brain is encouraged to form new connections between neurons (Park and Bischof, 2013). This strengthens communication within existing networks and can potentially create new pathways for cognitive function (Park and Bischof, 2013).

Strengthening existing connections: Park and Bischof (2013) also discuss how repeatedly playing these games can reinforce the neural connections used for processing sounds and navigating spatial environments. This reinforcement, as they explain helps maintain the health and efficiency of these connections, potentially slowing their decline in dementia.

Improved cognitive function in key areas: Studies by Boggio et al. (2011) suggest that stimulating cognitive function can improve spatial awareness and memory in dementia patients. Games that target these areas directly can provide targeted training and potentially enhance these critical cognitive skills (Park and Bischof, 2013).

\section{Designing for Dementia}
This section explores design choices within HarmonyScape that are specifically tailored to create a positive and supportive experience for individuals with dementia. We'll examine how sounds, visual cues, and gameplay perspectives are considered to address the unique needs and challenges of this user group.

\subsection{Noise Sensitivity in Dementia}\label{sec:noise_sensitivity}
Research by Shirsat, Jha and Verma (2023) highlights the negative effects that disruptive or unpleasant sounds can have on people living with dementia. Due to cognitive decline, dementia compromises the brain's ability to process and filter stimuli, making patients more sensitive to their surroundings (Shirsat, Jha and Verma, 2023). This means that noises others might easily ignore can cause confusion and agitation for those with dementia.

Sudden, loud, or jarring noises are especially likely to trigger a negative response, disrupting concentration, increasing anxiety, and contributing to behavioural problems (Shirsat, Jha and Verma, 2023). Even background noise can become overwhelming and disorienting for someone with dementia if it includes loud or jarring noises (Shirsat, Jha and Verma, 2023).

Understanding this impact is crucial in making HarmonyScape a supportive tool for individuals living with dementia. Minimising unnecessary noise, designing spaces with good acoustics, and using soothing sounds like calming music will be essential for promoting comfort and reducing distress for individuals with dementia as they explore the game (Caspar et al., 2017).

\subsection{Progress Tracking in Supporting Players with Dementia}\label{sec:progress_tracking}
Players with dementia often experience short-term memory challenges, making it difficult to recall previous actions or retain  information within a gameplay session. A progress tracker can be particularly helpful for this group, as it provides a visual and tangible representation of their achievements. Studies suggest that external memory aids, such as visual representations of progress, can support memory function in individuals with dementia (Bourgeois et al., 2003). Seeing progress reinforces a sense of accomplishment and  provides a clear marker of progress within the game. This, in turn, could enhance motivation and engagement for players living with dementia as they progress through HarmonyScape, potentially leading to improved well-being (Orrell et al., 2017). Furthermore, elements like progress trackers can tap into this concept of positive reinforcement, promoting enjoyment within computerised activities (Vermeir et al., 2020).

\subsection{Third-Person Perspective in Dementia-Focused Game Design}\label{sec:third_person}
There are a couple of compelling reasons to consider a third-person perspective in games designed for those with dementia

Firstly, simulation sickness, a form of motion sickness induced by virtual environments, is a common issue in gaming, particularly within first-person perspectives (Hancock et al., 2008). This mismatch between visual cues of movement and a lack of corresponding physical motion can lead to nausea, disorientation, and headaches (Hancock et al., 2008). Individuals with cognitive decline may be especially susceptible to simulation sickness due to a decline in spatial awareness (Li et al., 2024). This difficulty in understanding their position in relation to the virtual environment can exacerbate feelings of disorientation, dizziness, and nausea that are common with simulation sickness (Lin et al., 2002). A study by Lin et al. (2002) demonstrated that a third-person perspective offers a potential solution, with individuals experiencing significantly fewer symptoms of simulator sickness when navigating a virtual environment from this viewpoint. By creating visual distance between the player and the character's movement, a third-person perspective lessens the sensory conflict that contributes to simulation sickness (Lin et al., 2002).

Secondly, a third-person perspective in video games significantly enhances situational awareness. This expanded viewpoint offers a greater field of view, enabling the player to simultaneously observe their character and a larger portion of the virtual environment (Denisova \& Cairns, 2015). This increased visual overview could be helpful in mitigating spatial disorientation and confusion (Denisova \& Cairns, 2015), which are common challenges in those with dementia (Li et al., 2024). The ability to see the player-controlled character within the context of the game world may provide a more stable reference point (Denisova \& Cairns, 2015), potentially aiding spatial understanding and awareness within the game.


% \section{Related Works}
% In my review of existing literature, I found a notable absence of multisensory experiences tailored for individuals with intellectual disabilities such as Alzheimer’s that incorporate active music theory within a gaming setting. However, a range of experiences created for both academic and commercial purposes have been introduced with a similar goal as that of HarmonyScape in aiding those with intellectual disabilities, including conditions like Alzheimer’s, in enhancing their cognitive well-being in an enjoyable, interactive manner.

% \subsection{AARP Staying Sharp}
% AARP Staying Sharp is an online platform provided by AARP (formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons) that offers a variety of brain-training games and activities designed to help individuals maintain cognitive function and mental acuity as they age. These games cover a range of cognitive skills such as memory, attention, problem-solving, and language.

% \end{figure}

% Although AARP Staying Sharp has great potential in helping individuals maintain cognitive function through its variety of brain-training games and activities, a key downfall is the sole use of uni-sensory stimulation, and so is missing out on the range of potential benefits shown from multisensory treatment in those with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's.

% Sánchez et al. (2016) discuss these potential positive effects in comparison to uni-sensory experiences in the treatment of people with severe dementia. Specifically, they discuss the beneficial impact on anxiety symptoms that comes from stimulating different senses which allows for greater sensory environment control. HarmonyScape aims to capitalise on the principles outlined by Sánchez et al. (2016), offering multisensory engagement that intertwines visual and auditory stimuli.

\chapter{Requirements}

This chapter dives into the specific requirements HarmonyScape needs to meet to effectively achieve the goals outlined in Chapter 1. These requirements leverage and build upon the research and relevant concepts explored in Chapter 2, ensuring the game aligns with established best practices. I will refer to these requirements throughout the rest of the dissertation by their ID's such as 'FR-1'.

\section{Functional Requirements}
This section presents the functional requirements for HarmonyScape, informed by the research in Chapter 2. The MoSCow method prioritises these requirements, categorising them based on their necessity to achieving the evaluation goals: some are essential for core functionality (Must Haves), while others significantly enhance the user experience (Should Haves), and some are desirable for future iterations (Could Haves).

FR-1 & Must Have & \textbf{Interactive Music:} HarmonyScape's music must be interactive, dynamically responding to the player's movements. This aligns with Active Music Theory (Vink AC \emph{et al.,} 2004), where the players active participation directly affects the games soundscape. The aim of this feature is to encourage a sense of control and creative exploration through allowing players to influence the musical composition. Whilst also facilitating cognitive stimulation through providing opportunity for players to solve problems or puzzles through musical interaction. \\ 
\hline

\chapter{Design}
This chapter explores the design considerations and implementation choices that shape HarmonyScape. We'll begin with an overview of the final design, followed by in-depth discussions of key decisions that align with the requirements outlined in the previous chapter.

% \section{Guidance}
% Design should cover the abstract design in such a way that someone else might be able to do what you did, but with a different language or library or tool.

\section{Overview}
HarmonyScape employs a 3D environment rendered in the Unity game engine and utilises a third-person perspective for player navigation. This viewpoint choice aims to foster a sense of immersion and presence within the game world (see Section \ref{sec:third_person}). The core gameplay loop centres around the discovery and completion of minigames strategically placed throughout the explorable environment. These minigames are designed to target various cognitive abilities, offering a playful and engaging way to exercise these skills.

Successful completion of a minigame unlocks a corresponding instrument track within the multi-layered musical composition. As players progress, they incrementally reveal the complete song. The game culminates when all individual instruments within the composition have been collected, and the full musical piece is unlocked. This dynamic music system provides auditory feedback and creates a sense of progression and accomplishment. This, along with the game's visual elements, contributes to the multisensory experience outlined in FR-2.

HarmonyScape aims to cultivate a sense of calmness and gentle challenge. The combination of a calming visual environment, intuitive controls, and the soothing nature of the music aims to create a low-pressure atmosphere, in line with FR-3 (Gentle Audio Design). Minigames offer moments of focused engagement but are designed to minimise frustration. The emphasis is on the journey of exploration and the joy of unlocking the musical composition layer by layer, rather than on competition or stressful time limits.

HarmonyScape's dynamic music system creates a unique interplay between player action and the auditory experience. The tempo of the music directly responds to the player's movement, accelerating as the character gains speed and decelerating as they slow down. This seamless connection between movement and music fosters a sense of agency and encourages physical engagement. Players become active participants in shaping the soundscape, with their own exploration directly influencing the pace and intensity of the composition.

The game's design prioritises clear visual cues and forgiving mechanics, aiming to offer a welcoming and success-oriented experience. This dynamic musical feedback highlights HarmonyScape's focus on the positive interplay between music, movement, and cognitive engagement.

\section{Unity as a Development Tool}
HarmonyScape will utilise the Unity game engine as its development foundation. This engine provides a versatile set of tools for crafting 3D environments, interactive components, and gameplay systems. Its straightforward interface supports the realisation of HarmonyScape's central elements, including multisensory minigames and the dynamic music system.

\subsection{Reasons for selecting Unity}
The decision to employ Unity as the primary development tool stems from several key considerations. Firstly, Unity's widespread use within the game development industry offers access to substantial documentation, community support, and educational materials. Offering valuable guidance throughout the development process.

Secondly, Unity's asset store provides access to pre-made models, sound effects, and other resources. This marketplace can streamline development and reduce the need for custom content creation, which can save both time and resources.

Finally, Unity's suitability for novice developers makes it an ideal choice for this project. Its comprehensive resources and intuitive tools provide a strong foundation for learning core game development skills in 3D environment design, basic scripting, and gameplay logic.

\section{Player Movement and Control}\label{sec:move_&_control}
HarmonyScape will feature a player movement system designed for intuitive control and ease of use. The mechanics of this system are outlined in the following subsections.

\subsection{Movement Mechanics}

\subsubsection{Standard Input:} Movement control will adhere to widely-used conventions found in 3D games. Specifically, directional input through the WASD keys on a keyboard. This design choice aims to promote familiarity and minimise the learning curve for players.

\subsubsection{Acceleration:} To enhance the realism of the movement system and player engagement, the character's speed will increase incrementally when the player initiates movement. This smooth transition in velocity simulates momentum and avoids a disruptive change from a stationary state to full speed. This design feature will have particular relevance for the dynamic music system, which will be elaborated upon in a subsequent section.

\subsubsection{Jumping Mechanic:} The player will have the ability to jump via a dedicated button or key. This mechanic, familiar to players of many classic games, offers increased freedom of movement and may provide advantages or creative options for navigating minigame challenges.

\section{Terrain}
HarmonyScape's island terrain is divided into four distinct areas: a grassy section, a rocky hill, a snowy mountain, and a sandy beach. These areas are designed to enhance player navigation and orientation. Each area possesses unique visual characteristics. The grassy section features grass and dirt textures, along with trees and flowers (see Figure \ref{fig:terrain_grassy}). The rocky hill transitions to textures of stone and soil, with scattered rocks providing additional markers (see Figure \ref{fig:terrain_rocky}). The snowy mountain utilises snow textures and a snowfall effect for differentiation (see Figure \ref{fig:terrain_snowy}). Finally, the beach features a sandy section bordered by the surrounding water (see Figure \ref{fig:terrain_beach}). These design choices aid the player in recognising transitions between areas and improve their understanding of their location within the terrain.

  \end{subfigure}
  ~  
  \caption{Screenshots showcasing the four distinct areas within the HarmonyScape island terrain.} 
  \label{fig:terrain}
\end{figure}

HarmonyScape's terrain is designed to subtly guide players towards minigame locations. The grassy areas feature gentle slopes that naturally incline towards puzzle challenges. The rocky hill features a subtle ridge that leads the player towards an open area ideal for a minigame challenge. Paths branch through the terrain, offering an alternative route for those who desire more structure while preserving the sense of discovery. These environmental cues aim to create an intuitive sense of direction within the world, gently encouraging exploration.

\subsection{Music Note Indicators}
While the terrain offers natural direction, HarmonyScape incorporates an additional guidance system designed with accessibility in mind (NFR-1). Floating musical notes appear above minigames that the player has yet to discover, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:floating_notes}. A subtle particle effect beneath these notes enhances their visibility within the landscape. This visual cue provides an optional indication of unexplored areas, supporting players who may benefit from additional navigational assistance, while still allowing them the freedom of self-directed discovery.



\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{dissertation/images/floating_notes.png} 
    \caption{A view within HarmonyScape's terrain, showcasing one of the floating music notes with particle effects guiding the player towards a minigame area. }
    \label{fig:floating_notes} 
\end{figure}

\section{Minigames}
This section describes the minigames within HarmonyScape and their design decisions, which prioritise accessibility (NFR-1). These minigames incorporate elements of familiar traditional games, music-based activities, active music theory, and spatial navigation challenges, all presented with clear visual and auditory cues to support players with varying cognitive abilities. These minigames are designed with forgiving mechanics (NFR-3), allowing players to retry without penalty and ensuring there are no fail states within the experience.

\subsection{Card Matching}
HarmonyScape incorporates a card matching minigame, building upon the principles of NFR-2 to emphasize clear visual feedback and a sense of interaction. This also leverages the concept of familiarity and engagement in traditional games discussed in Section \ref{sec:traditional_games}. In this game, players must uncover pairs of cards by physically interacting with them within the 3D environment and remembering their positions. This familiar mechanic aligns with the findings of De Siqueira et al. (2017) who highlight that familiarity with traditional games reduces the need for introduction and assistance, promoting engagement in patients with dementia.

Furthermore, playing a card matching game requires attention, and memory recall, which can help stimulate cognitive function in individuals with dementia (Eichhorn et al., 2018). The game directly targets memory skills by challenging players to remember the location of matching pairs of cards, which Eichhorn et al. (2018) discuss as having the potential to improve short-term memory and concentration.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{dissertation/images/mem_matching.jpg}    

    \caption{Screenshots of different scenes when playing the digital card matching memory game by MemoryMatching.com
    }

    \label{fig:mem_match} 
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:mem_match} shows screenshots from a digital implementation of the card-matching memory game by MemoryMatching.com. HarmonyScape will adapt this concept into a 3D space where the player-controlled character will need to make physical contact with the cards to flip them. HarmonyScape's implementation involves 5 pairs of cards placed within the minigame area. Each card is a cube object, with altered dimensions to resemble a card, and functions as a trigger zone. The player will enter the cards trigger zone which will initiate a physical flip of the card on the screen. This emphasis on a physical action to trigger a visible change reinforces the principles of NFR-2.

\subsection{Sliding Puzzle}
A sliding puzzle is a classic game comprising a grid of square or rectangular tiles, with one space left empty to enable movement. Players aim to rearrange the tiles by sliding them horizontally or vertically into the vacant space until they align in a predetermined pattern or sequence, typically forming a complete picture or achieving a specific numerical order (Hearn, 2005).

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{dissertation/images/uncompleted_sliding.png}
        \caption{Uncompleted sliding puzzle.}
        \label{fig:slide_uncompleted}
    \end{subfigure}

    \end{subfigure}
    ~  
    \caption{Screenshots from a brain training application developed by Sasaki et al. (2020), demonstrating the progression of a sliding puzzle. The left image shows the puzzle before manipulation, while the right image displays the puzzle after the tiles have been rearranged to form the correct image. This example illustrates the type of sliding puzzle mechanic that HarmonyScape will also incorporate.
    }\label{fig:sliding_puzzle}
\end{figure}

Similar to the traditional sliding block puzzle and the implementation by Sasaki et al. (2020) – as illustrated in Figures \ref{fig:slide_uncompleted} and \ref{fig:slide_completed} – HarmonyScape's version challenges the user to manipulate the panels within the frame to arrange tiles into the desired order. As discussed in Section \ref{sec:sliding_dementia}, this type of puzzle engages cognitive functions – including memory, spatial awareness, and figure arrangement – that may have the potential to slow the progression of dementia (Sasaki et al., 2020).

It's also important to note that, to aid in solving the puzzle, a visual representation of its completed state will be provided within the player's field of view during the minigame. Providing a visual representation of the puzzle's solved state offers a crucial support mechanism for players with dementia, prioritising accessibility (NFR-1). This reference image can alleviate potential confusion or frustration that may arise from the puzzle's mechanics. By having a clear visual goal, players, particularly those who may experience difficulty with abstract problem-solving, can better understand the task at hand and form strategies to achieve the correct solution.  This design choice aims to create a more positive and inclusive gameplay experience.

\subsection{Music Memory Games}
To reinforce the game's multisensory design (FR-2), HarmonyScape incorporates visual and auditory feedback mechanisms within its minigames. One example is the music memory minigame. 

The concept of memory games involving sequences of sounds can be traced back to various sources and inspirations. However, one notable origin of such games is the electronic game "Simon" which was invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison in 1978 (Baer \& Morrison, 1980). As seen in Figure \ref{fig:simon}, "Simon" consists of four coloured buttons (green, red, blue, and yellow) that light up and produce unique sounds in a sequence (Baer \& Morrison, 1980). Players have to memorise the sequence and then repeat it back by pressing the corresponding buttons (Baer \& Morrison, 1980).

  \label{fig:simon}  
\end{figure}

A systematic review conducted by Clare et al. (2003) examined the effectiveness of cognitive interventions in dementia care. The review found evidence supporting the beneficial effects of cognitive stimulation interventions on various aspects of cognitive function, including attention and concentration. Activities such as "Simon" which necessitate both selective attention to focus on specific elements and sustained attention to accurately remember and reproduce sequences, have been identified as potentially beneficial interventions for addressing the attention impairments associated with dementia, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:attention} (Clare et al., 2003).

These principles guided the design of a minigame within HarmonyScape. This minigame plays different guitar notes, requiring users to memorise the order and replicate it. Players engage with visual 'blocks' that represent unique notes, allowing them to reproduce the sequence by remembering the note order and interacting with the corresponding blocks.

To provide clear feedback that a note has been played, the Note Block will temporarily disappear from view. It will reappear after a short delay that matches the length of the note. This combination of visual and auditory cues reinforces the multisensory experience (FR-2).

The minigame's design aligns with principles of active music therapy, as detailed in Section \ref{sec:music_therapy}, where individuals engage in the process of music-making (Vink AC et al. 2004).  While the minigame isn't a therapeutic intervention in itself, it mirrors the active participation, cognitive stimulation, and sense of agency that are foundational to active music therapy approaches.

\subsection{Follow The Sound}
Games that utilise the "follow the sound" mechanic offer a unique opportunity to engage cognitive function and leverage neuroplasticity. In these games, players must navigate an environment by focusing on auditory cues, usually with the goal of locating the source of a sound. This type of gameplay directly stimulates spatial awareness and auditory processing.

The design for one of the minigames in HarmonyScape adopts a simplified approach to the follow-the-sound concept, relying exclusively on variations in volume (loudness) of the maraca sounds. This design choice, with its focus on the maracas as the primary auditory cue, creates a distinct challenge for players, requiring them to carefully analyse changes in loudness to inform their movement through the 3D environment. By directly linking player movement to the volume of the music, this minigame supports the interactive music requirement (FR-1). This gameplay mechanism emphasises volume-based spatial reasoning where players must translate changes in loudness into spatial decision-making within the virtual environment, developing a mental map based solely on auditory cues.

This stimulation of auditory perception and spatial awareness aligns with principles of neuroplasticity discussed in Section \ref{sec:neuroplasticity}. By potentially promoting the formation of new neural connections, strengthening existing pathways involved in auditory processing and spatial reasoning, and potentially improving memory and spatial awareness, this simple yet engaging game design offers a supportive and beneficial experience for individuals with dementia.

\section{Music}
HarmonyScape integrates music as a core gameplay element and a vital component of the immersive experience. This integration is realised through a unique design approach that prioritises a gentle soundscape in line with FR-3.

\subsection{Instrument Collection}
Upon successful completion of a minigame, players will discover a tangible model of the corresponding instrument available within the minigame's area. Collecting this model, accomplished through simple collision with the player-controlled character, unlocks the individual instrument track within the game's musical composition, fulfilling a key aspect of FR-1 (Interactive Music). This establishes a direct connection between player action and musical progression. Additionally, to introduce players to this concept, one instrument model will be strategically placed along the immediate path from the starting point, demonstrating this core gameplay mechanic.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Dynamic Music Feedback}

Stemming from the interactive music requirement (FR-1), HarmonyScape will feature an innovative dynamic music system where the tempo of the musical composition will be directly controlled by player movement. Specifically, the tempo will respond to the character's acceleration and deceleration. When the character is stationary, the music will play at half its intended speed. As the character begins to move and accelerate, the tempo will seamlessly increase until it reaches its normal pace at the character's maximum acceleration. Conversely, as the character decelerates, the musical tempo will decrease proportionally.

It is important to note that while the music responds to the character's deceleration, the character itself will come to a complete halt when no movement input is given. This design choice prevents jarring transitions in the musical tempo, ensuring a smooth auditory experience aligned with FR-3 (Gentle Audio Design). Whilst also avoiding any unpredictable movement that could disrupt gameplay and compromise player control. This sensitivity to potential disruption aligns with the findings in Section \ref{sec:noise_sensitivity}, which highlight the increased sensitivity to noises for individuals with dementia.

This integration of player movement directly influencing the musical experience aligns with the principles of active music therapy, a key goal of the interactive music requirement (FR-1). By linking tempo changes to their actions, players become active participants in shaping the soundscape. This encourages physical engagement, a sense of control over the musical output, and a potentially heightened sense of accomplishment as the music reaches its full tempo through their own movement.

\section{Menu Screens}
HarmonyScape employs familiar menu structures (FR-6) such as instructions, pause, title, and end screens. This design choice aims to provide a sense of predictability and ease of use, drawing from classic gaming experiences. This focus aligns with the project's overall aim to leverage known gaming elements for this generation, as discussed in the introduction. These familiar structures should provide a sense of comfort and predictability.

\subsubsection{The Title Screen} establishes a clear starting point. It will feature a simple display of the game title and a "Start" button, providing a clear entry point into the experience (see Figure \ref{fig:title_screen}).

\begin{figure}[h]

  \end{subfigure}
  ~  
  \caption{Screenshots illustrating the design of HarmonyScape's title and instructions screens. }
  \label{fig:intro_screens}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The Instructions Screen} will clearly present core controls and gameplay mechanics using simple visuals and concise language, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:instructions_screen}. This screen acknowledges the importance of repetition and reinforcement for those with cognitive decline, creating a familiar point of reference and reducing confusion.

\subsubsection{The Pause Screen} will allow for cognitive breaks during gameplay, managing sensory input and offering moments of rest. Users will be able to easily revisit the instructions screen for reminders, supporting those who may have short-term memory difficulties, see Figure \ref{fig:pause_screen}. The user will also have the option to resume gameplay, go to back to the main menu.

\begin{figure}[h]

 \caption{HarmonyScape pause screen with options to access instructions, resume, go back to the menu and quit the game.}
 \label{fig:pause_screen} 
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The End screen} offers a distinct conclusion to a gameplay session. It will include a progress summary displaying the instruments collected, reinforcing a sense of accomplishment (see Figure \ref{fig:end_screen}).

\begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{dissertation/images/end_screen.png} 
 \caption{Screenshot of the HarmonyScape end screen, featuring a progress summary highlighting the player's collected instruments.}
 \label{fig:end_screen} 
\end{figure}

\section{Progress Tracker}
To support players with visual feedback and promote a sense of accomplishment (FR-4), HarmonyScape will incorporate a visual progress tracker. This system features instrument icons displayed in the top left corner of the screen. Initially presented in black and white, these icons gain colour as the player successfully completes the corresponding minigame and unlocks the instrument, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:progress_tracker}. This colour transformation provides immediate visual feedback, signifying achievement and clearly marking which instruments have been collected.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{dissertation/images/progress_tracker_empty.png}

  ~  
  \caption{Screenshots of the HarmonyScape progress tracker. The left image shows the tracker's initial state, while the right image demonstrates the transformation after collecting some instruments.}
  \label{fig:progress_tracker}
\end{figure}

The progress tracker's design aligns with the principles outlined in Section \ref{sec:progress_tracking} as it serves as an external memory aid, helping players with dementia to recall their progress within the game. This visual representation reinforces accomplishment as there is feedback on their progress, promoting a sense of achievement. This design aims to reduces potential frustration that might stem from memory difficulties.

\chapter{Implementation}

\section{Development Environment}
This section describes the development environment that the project was set up in. This includes, Unity version, programming languages, IDEs and external libraries and assets used.

\subsection{Unity Version}
Unity Version 2022.3.10f1 LTS was chosen for the development of HarmoyScape. Unity's Long-Term Support (LTS) version was selected to ensure stability and access to extensive documentation throughout the development process.

\subsection{Programming Language}
C\# is the primary language in Unity for creating custom scripts that define the behaviour of game objects, handle player input, manage game logic, and interface with Unity's various systems (UI, physics, etc.). This is the sole programming language that was used in the development of HarmonyScape.

\subsection{Integrated Development Environment (IDE)}
Visual Studio Code was chosen as the development environment due to its lightweight footprint, seamless Unity integration, and robust debugging capabilities.

\subsection{External Libraries and Assets}
To streamline development and enhance HarmonyScape's visuals, external libraries and assets from the Unity Asset Store were used. These resources include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item TextMeshPro: \footnote{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.textmeshpro.html}: This package was used for the text elements within the game including the instructions and menus.
    \item Unity-Standard-Assets \footnote{https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-thirdperson-updates-in-new-charactercontroller-pa-196526}: Used for instrument models and icons.
    \item Rock Package\footnote{https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/rock-package-118182}: This package was used for the rock objects placed through the terrain.
    \item Grass and Flowers Pack\footnote{https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/nature/grass-and-flowers-pack-1-17100}: This package was used for the grass and flowers through the terrain.

    \item Conifers [BOTD]\footnote{https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/conifers-botd-142076}: This was used for the trees in the terrain.
    \item RPG Monster DUO PBR Polyart\footnote{https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/rpg-monster-duo-pbr-polyart-157762}: This was used for the player-controlled character model.
    \item Flooded\_Grounds\footnote{https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/flooded-grounds-48529}: This was used for the water placed around the perimeter of the terrain.
\end{itemize}

\section{Terrain and Navigation}
Before implementing player interactivity, minigames, or the dynamic music system, we needed to create a player-controlled character, a terrain for the character to explore and interact with, and establish a third-person camera perspective.

\subsection{Player-Controlled Character}\label{sec:player_script}
The character, originally a capsule, was brought in with an attached "Player Control" script, that had basic input, jump and rotation handling.

\subsubsection{HandleInput():}
The HandleInput() function, within the "Player Movement Script", is responsible for gathering player input and translating it into a desired movement direction. It retrieves horizontal and vertical axis values from Unity's Input system, which correspond to the commonly used WASD and arrow keys on a keyboard, either can be used depending on player preference. Using these familiar controls promotes ease of use and minimises the learning curve for players, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:move_&_control}. These input values are used to construct a 3D vector (movement direction) that captures the direction the player wants to move. The magnitude of this vector is calculated and clamped between 0 and 1, ensuring that movement speed remains consistent regardless of direction. Finally, the function returns this calculated movement direction, ready to be used by the MoveAndRotatePlayer() function.

\subsubsection{HandleJumping():}
The HandleJumping() function, within the "Player Movement Script", manages all logic related to the player's jumping ability. It first checks if the character is grounded, meaning the player is currently touching the floor. If so, it records the current time as 'lastGroundedTime'. The function listens for the "Jump" button press (the space-bar). If pressed, the jump button pressed time is recorded. It then manages a short grace period after leaving the ground, allowing the player to jump even if they didn't press the button the exact moment they left the ground. During this grace period, it adjusts the character's step offset and sets the vertical speed (ySpeed) to initiate the jump.

\subsubsection{MoveAndRotatePlayer():}
The MoveAndRotatePlayer() function, within the "Player Movement Script", takes the calculated movement direction and handles the core tasks of physically moving the player and smoothly rotating them to face their movement direction. It first creates a velocity vector by multiplying the movement direction with the player's current speed. The vertical component of this velocity (velocity.y) is set to the ySpeed variable, which is influenced by gravity and jumping. The 'CharacterController.Move()' function is then called to apply this velocity, updating the player's position. Finally, if the player is moving, the function calculates a target rotation based on movement direction and smoothly rotates the player object towards that target.

\subsection{Terrain}
HarmonyScape's terrain was crafted utilising Unity's built-in terrain editor. The raise/lower tools were employed to sculpt hills and valleys, while the paint texture tool was used to apply the various textures present throughout the island environment.  Additionally, the snow effect was achieved through the use of Unity's integrated particle system editor.

\subsection{Camera System}
Cinemachine is a powerful suite of tools included within Unity that provides intelligent and dynamic camera behaviours. It simplifies the process of creating complex camera systems, allowing developers to focus on the desired look and feel of the game rather than the low-level technical implementation of camera control.

HarmonyScape implements the Cinemachine Free Look Camera, a versatile camera component designed to offer third-person style camera perspectives. This choice is rooted in the theory discussed in Section \ref{sec:third_person}, which highlights the benefits of a third-person perspective for players who may be more susceptible to simulation sickness and require enhanced situational awareness. It's commonly used in games where players need the flexibility to control the camera view to observe their surroundings and character. The Free Look Camera system consists of three virtual camera rigs (top, middle, and bottom) that orbit around a target object, with a spline system seamlessly blending between them.

In HarmonyScape, I've set the target of the Cinemachine Free Look Camera to be the player-controlled character object. This ensures that the camera remains focused on the player as they move through the game world. The Free Look Camera functions as a component of the main camera, effectively overriding Unity's standard camera controls to provide the desired dynamic camera behaviour.

To prevent the camera from clipping through obstacles in the environment, I've added a Cinemachine Collider component to the Free Look Camera. This collider works in tandem with the camera system to detect potential collisions with objects in the scene. I've set the collider's strategy parameter to "Preserve Camera Distance". This means that if the camera's path would be obstructed, it smoothly readjusts its position to maintain a consistent distance from the player character, avoiding any jarring visual interruptions.

\subsubsection{How this affects the "Player Movement" script:} Within the Player Movement Script, the movement direction calculated from player input is modified based on the Cinemachine Free Look Camera's orientation. The movement direction is rotated around the vertical axis to match the camera's Y-axis rotation. This ensures that player movement aligns with the camera's view, providing an intuitive control scheme. Additionally, the movement direction is normalised to maintain consistent movement speed regardless of the applied rotation.

\section{Minigame Implementations}
The various minigames within HarmonyScape are each implemented based on the corresponding design outlined in the Design Chapter. They share a core structure, utilising a central "Minigame Master" script. This master script handles the core logic for each minigame, including tracking the player's progress, evaluating win conditions, and managing the overall flow of the minigame. The "Follow the Sound" minigame functions differently, as will be explained in the following corresponding section. 

Each minigame has its own unique set of objects placed within the game world that are specific to that minigame's functionality. These objects will often have additional scripts attached to them that manage their individual behaviours and interactions with the player.

This section will delve into the specifics of each minigame implementation, detailing the functionalities of the Minigame Master script (where applicable), the unique objects used, and any additional scripts that contribute to their functionality.

\subsection{Fixed Camera for Minigames}
Each minigame within HarmonyScape temporarily overrides the standard camera behaviour to ensure a focused and user-friendly experience. This adjustment aims to provide players with a clear, unobstructed view of all the necessary minigame components, minimising potential confusion or frustration.
\newline

\textbf{Camera Controller Script:} \newline
This is achieved through a dedicated "CameraController" script attached to the main camera, which works in conjunction with trigger zones ("catchment areas") placed around each minigame location. When a player enters a catchment area, the trigger script signals the CameraController script to reposition and reorient the camera for optimal minigame visibility. This might involve a top-down view or a different specialised camera setup, depending on the minigame's requirements.

The player may choose to exit the catchment area before a minigame is completed if they wish to explore or attempt a different minigame. Upon exiting the minigame's catchment area, the trigger script signals the "CameraController" to reset the camera. This re-enables the Cinemachine camera, transitioning back to the free look camera used for regular exploration. Additionally, successful completion of the minigame will also disable the catchment area and reset the camera.

    
\subsubsection{How this helps the player:}
This fixed camera system offers several benefits for players, particularly those who may have difficulty with complex visual scenes or spatial awareness. It provides a focused view of the minigame area, reducing visual distractions, and ensures players have a clear understanding of the minigame's layout and objectives. This simplifies the gameplay experience, allowing players to concentrate on the minigame's core mechanics.

\subsection{Music Memory}
Completing the Music Memory minigame unlocks the Guitar part of the game's soundscape. At the core of the minigame are the interactive "Note Blocks." Each Note Block is a trigger zone within the game world, and they are equipped with a NotePlayer script. This script is responsible for several key functions.
\newline

\textbf{NotePlayer Script} \newline
The NotePlayer script manages the audio playback for its associated Note Block. When the player enters the trigger area, the script plays a unique audio clip representing that block's musical note, corresponding to notes A through E on a guitar. To provide the player with a clear indication that a note has been played, the script temporarily disables the Note Block's visual mesh and collider, making it appear to disappear, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mem_game}. After a short delay, corresponding to the length of the audio clip, the mesh and collider are re-enabled

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{dissertation/images/Memory_Game_HarmonyScape.png}
        \caption{Whilst no note is being played during the Music Memory minigame, waiting for player to input notes.}
        \label{fig:mem_game_unplayed}
    \end{subfigure}
    ~ 
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}

    \caption{Note Blocks in the Music Memory minigame, demonstrating their visual transformation when a note is played.
    }
    % use the notation fig:name to cross reference a figure
    \label{fig:mem_game} 
\end{figure}

A crucial part of the NotePlayer script is its communication with the central Guitar Game Master script, which we'll discuss later. When a Note Block is played, the script informs the Guitar Game Master of the note type (A, B, C, D or E). This allows the Guitar Game Master script to track the player's progress within the minigame's sequence.
\newline

\textbf{GuitarGameMaster Script} \newline
The GuitarGameMaster script serves as the central script for managing the Music Memory minigame's logic, progression, and completion. It's associated with a dedicated "Start Block" in the game world, shown as the larger block in both Figures \ref{fig:mem_game_unplayed} and  \ref{fig:mem_game_played}, which triggers the minigame when the player enters its area.

This script tracks the correct sequence of notes for the minigame and the player's current progress within that sequence. It communicates with the NotePlayer script on each Note Block to monitor when notes are played. Upon the player entering the Start Block's trigger area, the StartGame() function is activated, initialising the minigame.

During initialisation, the Guitar Game Master script prepares the minigame area by making the Note Blocks visible and enabling their colliders. To ensure the player can focus on memorising the sequence, their movement is temporarily restricted. 

\subsubsection{PlaySong():} The PlaySong() function plays the correct sequence of notes for the player to memorise. Visual cues in the form of text changes (from "LISTEN" to "GO") signal when the player should listen for the sequence and then when they can start attempting the sequence.

\subsubsection{NotePlayed():} The NotePlayed() function is the core of progress tracking during the music memory minigame. When a Note Block's NotePlayer script informs it of a note being played, the GuitarGameMaster compares it to the expected note at the current point in the sequence. Correct notes advance the player's progress. An incorrect note will trigger the ResetGame() function, resetting the sequence back to the beginning. Successfully playing all notes in the correct order triggers the FinishGame() function, ending the game, removing other minigame elements, and making the guitar model available to be collected in the minigame area.

If the player needs a reminder of the note order, they can re-enter the Start Block. This will reset the 'currentNoteIndex' and activate the PlaySong function, replaying the musical sequence. This design feature allows players to reinforce their memory of the sequence before proceeding with another attempt.


\subsection{Card Matching}
Completing the Card Matching minigame unlocks the Triangle instrument in the game's soundscape. The cards are organised into pairs using a shared tag system (e.g., "Card\_A", "Card\_B"). To help with identification, cards within a pair are named with a letter and number combination (e.g., "A\_1" and "A\_2"). Figure \ref{fig:card_matching_overview} provides a visual representation of the initial layout of the Card Matching minigame, with all cards face-down.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{dissertation/images/CardFlip_Before.png} 

  \caption{Screenshot of the point-of-view from the player of the Card Matching minigame area.}

  \label{fig:card_matching_overview} 
\end{figure}

\textbf{CardFlip Script} \newline
Attached to each of the cards, the CardFlip script is responsible for managing the visual flipping behaviour of individual cards and communicating these actions to the main Triangle Game Master script, which we'll discuss in the following section. When the player collides with a card's trigger zone, the OnTriggerEnter() function initiates the card-flipping process called FlipCard().

\subsubsection{FlipCard() and FlipBack():} The FlipCard() coroutine within the script handles the physical flipping animation of the card, simulating the action of flipping an actual card. It involves moving the card upwards, rotating it 180 degrees around the Z-axis, and then returning it to its original position. Importantly, the script communicates with the Triangle Game Master script via the FlipCard() function, informing the minigame's central logic system that a card has been flipped. There's also a FlipBack() coroutine to handle flipping the cards back to their original state if the game logic requires it.

To prevent the player from interacting with multiple cards too quickly, both script's manage internal state using an 'isFlipping' flag. Additionally, they works in conjunction with the TriangleGameMaster script's 'IsProcessingMatch' flag to ensure the game logic processes card flips avoiding multiple cards being flipped at once.

\textbf{TriangleGameMaster Script} \newline
The Triangle Game Master script serves as the central script for managing the Card Matching minigame's logic, progression, and completion. It maintains a record of flipped cards and facilitates the primary matching logic. Upon the initiation of a card flip, the FlipCard() function verifies if the card has already been flipped. If it's a new flip, the card is added to a tracking list. When two cards have been flipped over, the CheckForMatch() function determines if their tags match, signifying a successful pair.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{dissertation/images/CardFlip_WrongPair.png} 
  \caption{Screenshot demonstrating the `Triangle Game Master` script's handling of incorrect card pairings. Mismatched cards are visually flipped back to their face-down state.} 
  \label{fig:card_mismatch} 
\end{figure}

If a match is found, the cards are visually deactivated to represent their removal from the active play area, as illustrated in \ref{fig:card_matching_success}. Conversely, if the cards do not match, the FlipBackCards() function is called. This process, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:card_mismatch}, restores mismatched cards to their face-down state. The AllMatchesMade() function determines if all pairs have been discovered. After the player successfully pairs all card sets, the minigame ends, making the triangle instrument model available for collection within the minigame area.

 \caption{Series of screenshots demonstrating the visual outcomes of the `Triangle Game Master` script's card matching logic, focusing on successful matches and their consequences.}  

 \label{fig:card_matching_success} 
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sliding Puzzle}
Completing the Sliding Puzzle minigame unlocks the Ukulele in the game's soundscape. This section will delve into the technical aspects of the sliding puzzle minigame. We'll begin by examining the teleportation mechanic, exploring how the player is seamlessly transferred from the snowy mountain environment to the dedicated puzzle platform. Following that, we'll deconstruct the individual components that make up the puzzle itself. Finally, we'll analyse the scripts attached to these individual components, uncovering the logic and behaviours that govern their functionality within the puzzle.

It is also important to note that the sliding puzzle platform incorporates invisible borders to prevent the player from accidentally falling off. This design element ensures a safe and uninterrupted gameplay experience. This was implemented in the same way as the borders for the terrain itself, objects around the perimeter with colliders but no mesh. This makes it so the barrier is there but is invisible so the player can still see their surroundings.
\newline

\textbf{Teleportation Script} \newline
The sliding puzzle presents a unique intellectual challenge, requiring careful analysis and strategic thinking. To optimise the player's focus and mitigate potential distractions from the snowy mountain environment, they are briefly teleported to a separate platform. This isolated space minimises visual interference, allowing the player to fully concentrate on solving the puzzle. Upon completion, the player will be returned to the mountain location to continue their journey.

This teleportation functionality is managed by a dedicated script attached to a distinct blue box within the snowy mountain environment, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:teleportation}. This blue box visually contrasts with the snowy surroundings, providing a clear point of interaction for the player. When the player enters the trigger zone surrounding the blue box, the OnTriggerEnter() function is automatically called. The script then verifies if the entering object is the player. If confirmed, the script initiates the teleportation process, instantly moving the player to the designated puzzle platform. The 'teleportTarget' variable within the script holds a reference to the transform component of the destination platform, ensuring the player arrives at the location of the platform to begin solving the puzzle.

\subsubsection{How this helps the player:} The isolated platform removes visual complexity from the snowy mountain, allowing players to devote their full attention to the puzzle. The dedicated space encourages focused problem-solving without the potential for environmental distractions. Additionally,  the brief teleportation adds a sense of transitioning into a focused mental space.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{dissertation/images/Sliding_Teleport.png} 
  \caption{Screenshot of the teleportation mechanism within the snowy mountain environment. The blue box initiates the player's teleportation to the puzzle platform.} 
  \label{fig:teleportation} 
\end{figure}

\textbf{CubeMovement Script} \newline
The CubeMovement script is attached to each of the movable puzzle pieces within the sliding puzzle minigame. Its responsibility is managing the movement of these pieces and ensuring the fundamental rules of the puzzle are consistently upheld. The script includes an isMoving flag to prevent the player from attempting multiple moves simultaneously, to ensure the puzzle mechanics are smooth and predictable.

\subsubsection{OnTriggerEnter(), CanMove() and MoveWithLerp():} The OnTriggerEnter() function is automatically triggered upon collision between a puzzle piece's collider and the player. The CanMove() function determines the validity of a move based on the sliding puzzle's rules. It verifies that the puzzle piece is directly adjacent to the empty space and confirms the absence of any obstructing puzzle pieces blocking its path. Finally, the MoveWithLerp() coroutine is responsible for the visual movement of the puzzle piece to the empty space's position. It leverages a function called 'Lerp()' for linear interpolation, resulting in an smooth transition of the puzzle piece from its original space to the empty space. This coroutine also updates the 'isMoving' flag to accurately manage the movement state of the puzzle piece.\newline

\textbf{UkuleleGameMaster Script} \newline
The UkuleleGameMaster script serves as the central script for managing the sliding puzzle minigame. It is attached to an empty game object that is the parent object of the sliding puzzle pieces. Its responsibility is to manage the logic, progress tracking, and win checking of the minigame. The script includes a cubes array that maintains references to all movable puzzle pieces. Additionally, the 'winPositions' array stores references to the designated target positions for each individual puzzle piece. The player must correctly position all puzzle pieces in these target positions to successfully complete the puzzle (see Figure \ref{fig:puzzle_incomplete}).

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{dissertation/images/Sliding_Incomplete.png} 
  \caption{Screenshot of the sliding puzzle in progress. The player must move the pieces into the order shown in the image with the black background above the puzzle itself.} 
  \label{fig:puzzle_incomplete} 
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{CheckWin():} The CheckWin() function determines these winning conditions. The function iterates through the cubes array, comparing the position of each puzzle piece to its corresponding target position stored within the 'winPositions' array. Should all pieces align with their designated targets, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:puzzle_complete}, the function returns true, signifying the puzzle as complete. Conversely, if a mismatch exists, the function returns false, signifying the puzzle as incomplete.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{dissertation/images/Sliding_Complete.png} 
  \caption{Screenshot of the completed sliding puzzle. This visual reference, provided during the minigame, aids players in understanding the puzzle's goal and solution.} 
  \label{fig:puzzle_complete} 
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Update():} The Update() function is called automatically on each frame of gameplay. Its purpose is to continuously assess the win condition of the puzzle by employing the CheckWin() function. Upon successful completion of the puzzle, this triggers the activation of the Ukulele object, making it available for collection within the minigame area, and the resetting of the camera to its default position.

\subsection{Follow The Sound}
Upon completion of the "Follow the Sound of the Maracas" minigame, the Maracas instrument is added to the game's soundscape. This minigame is initiated by the player entering the minigames first model of a pair of maracas, triggering the "Load Maracas Minigame" script. This script displays the instruction "Follow the Sound of the Maracas" in the UI against a contrasting white background, and it activates an audio cue to guide the player. Progression through the minigame is governed by the 'Maracas Minigame Audio' script, which manages the sequential activation and deactivation of sound sources. This script also adjusts audio properties based on player proximity, providing the player navigation cues. Successful completion, initiated by interaction with the final pair of maracas, triggers the "End Maracas Minigame" script. This script removes the UI text and unlocks the "maracas" instrument to be collected.
\newline

\textbf{Load Maracas Minigame Script} \newline
The "Load Maracas Minigame" script is attached to the initial pair of maracas within the game's terrain, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:maracas_trigger}. This serves as the entry point for the "Follow the Sound of the Maracas" minigame. Upon the player triggering the maracas by entering them, the script then sets up the minigame.

\begin{figure}[h]

The script begins by identifying and temporarily muting all audio sources attached to the player character, specifically the instruments they have previously unlocked. This ensures that external sounds do not interfere with the player's ability to navigate using the audio cues provided within the minigame. Additionally, the maracas object that triggered the script is visually disabled. This  reinforces to the player that they have initiated the minigame.

The script also disables all game objects within the environment that are not essential to the "Follow the Sound of the Maracas" minigame. This includes elements from other minigames that could potentially distract the player or obstruct the sound cues needed for the minigame's mechanics.

Another function of this script is to activate the "Maracas Minigame Audio" script, which manages the progression of auditory cues throughout the minigame. The script also presents on-screen instructions to clarify the minigame's objective for the player to 'Follow the Sound of the Maracas', as shown in Figure \ref{fig:maracas_setup}.
\newline

\textbf{MaracasMinigameAudio Script} \newline
The MaracasMinigameAudio script serves as the foundation of the progression through the 'Follow the Sound' minigame. This script manages several aspects of the audio experience to create the directional cues for the minigame gameplay. One of its primary functions is to dynamically control the volume of the audio source associated with each pair of maracas. It constantly calculates the distance between the player and the maracas, adjusting the maracas sound volume accordingly. As the player draws closer to a maracas pair, the sound intensifies, guiding them towards the source.

These modifications reinforce the start of the minigame.} 
 \label{fig:maracas_setup} 
\end{figure}

The script also controls the minigame's progression. It manages the activation and deactivation of audio sources associated with each maracas pair. This ensures a smooth transition between auditory cues as the player advances through the minigame. Upon interaction with a maracas pair, the script deactivates the current audio source and triggers the activation of the subsequent pair in the sequence.
\newline


\textbf{EndMaracasMinigame Script} \newline
After the player collects the last pair of maracas, this action initiates the EndMaracasMinigame script, signaling the successful completion of the 'Follow the Sound' minigame. This script's responsibility is to reverse the changes implemented by the LoadMaracasMinigame script, ensuring a smooth transition back to the primary game environment.

\subsubsection{UnmuteAudioSources() and EnableObjectRecursively():} The script begins by restoring the game's soundscape. It calls the UnmuteAudioSources() function, which iterates through the list of previously muted audio sources and reverses this process. This reintroduces the instrument tracks previously disabled for the focused gameplay experience of the minigame. Additionally, the script re-enables all game objects that were initially disabled by the LoadMaracasMinigame script. The EnableObjectRecursively() function ensures the activation of both parent and child objects throughout the game object hierarchy. Finally, the script deactivates the rest of the "Follow The Sound" minigame elements. It deactivates the minigame instructions and visually signifies the player's success by activating the Maracas instrument model and adding the Maracas to the game's soundscape.

\section{Dynamic Music System}
HarmonyScape's musical composition was a collaborative effort. The original music was composed and produced by Ashley Garven, with creative direction provided to ensure alignment with the game's overall focus on a calming atmosphere.

\subsection{Collection of Instruments}
Each instrument within the game world is represented by a distinct corresponding model. These models appear dynamically upon the completion of their corresponding minigames. To facilitate player interaction and the unlocking of the musical elements, each instrument model has the TriggerSFX script attached. The TriggerSFX script manages the audio source associated with a particular instrument. Upon initialisation (in the Start() method), the audio source begins playing but is immediately muted, to be unmuted when the instrument has been collected.

When the player enters the trigger zone associated with an instrument model (detected by the OnTriggerEnter() method), the script provides visual feedback. The audio source is unmuted, initiating the addition of the instrument's corresponding audio track to the game's soundscape. Additionally, the script swaps between two images, transitioning the instrument's visual appearance in the UI from a black and white representation to its corresponding colour image. This change further signifies the instrument's collection. Finally, the script deactivates the instrument model's mesh renderer and the game object itself, removing it from the scene.
    
\subsubsection{How this helps the player:}
The combination of audio and visual cues provides immediate feedback, confirming the player's success and their progress in unlocking the full composition. The dynamic change in the UI and the addition of the instrument track reinforces a sense of accomplishment and progress. Additionally, the seamless interaction with the model offers a clear and intuitive way to achieve a tangible in-game goal.

\subsection{Audio Track Management}
In HarmonyScape's dynamic music system, as previously discussed, each instrument has a corresponding audio track that plays continuously from the beginning. These audio sources are attached directly to the player-controlled character. This design choice ensures that the volume of each instrument track remains consistent, regardless of the player's location within the game world.  Additionally, by continuously playing the tracks from the start, the system guarantees each track's synchronisation with the other tracks within the dynamic soundscape. This design ensures the instrumental tracks remain in time with one another, ultimately recreating the original song played in its entirety when all instruments have been collected. Upon completion of a minigame and collection of the corresponding instrument model, the TriggerSFX script unmutes the associated audio track. This action integrates the new instrument into the game's evolving musical composition.

\subsubsection{How this helps the player:}
The consistent volume and synchronisation implemented in the music system provide a seamless and predictable auditory experience, in-line with FR-3. This allows players to clearly identify which instruments they have collected and track their progress towards completing the full musical piece. The smooth evolution of the music as instruments are unlocked enhances immersion and reinforces a sense of accomplishment.

\section{Dynamic Music Implementation}

\subsection{Acceleration and Deceleration}

Within the Player Movement script (as detailed in Section \ref{sec:player_script}), we have meticulously implemented acceleration and deceleration mechanics to enhance the player's sense of agency and control within the game world. To achieve a natural and responsive feel for player movement, we engaged in a process of iterative refinement and experimentation.
    
Several key variables govern the dynamics of the system. The 'maxSpeed' variable establishes an upper bound for the player's velocity. Modifying this value directly influences the overall pace of gameplay. The 'accelerationRate', calculated internally based on a target time to reach full speed, determines how swiftly the player attains their maximum velocity. Higher acceleration rates translate to a snappier sense of responsiveness, while lower rates create a more gradual build-up in speed. Conversely, the 'decelerationRate' variable dictates the rate at which the player's velocity decreases once directional input stops. A higher 'decelerationRate' yields a quicker halt, while a lower rate maintains a stronger sense of forward momentum.
    
\subsubsection{ManageSpeed():} The core logic for this system resides within the ManageSpeed() function. This function leverages 'Input.GetAxis()' to detect player input from the WASD keys. Upon detecting movement input, the function initiates an acceleration phase.  If no player input is detected, the function applies a deceleration phase. Crucially, the 'Mathf.Clamp()' function is used to ensure the 'currentSpeed' variable remains within the range (between 0 and 'maxSpeed').
    
The precise calibration of the 'accelerationRate' and 'decelerationRate' variables was of up-most importance. Extensive play-testing informed our iterative adjustments to achieve the desired balance of responsiveness and a natural feeling of inertia within the player's movement. This careful refinement was essential to the foundation of HarmonyScape's innovative dynamic music system. In the following subsection, we'll explain how the 'currentSpeed' value, calculated through this system, dynamically modulates the tempo of the game's music, offering a uniquely engaging auditory experience aligned with player movement.

\subsection{How the dynamic music based on movement was implemented} 
Within the UpdateAudioTempo() function, a direct correlation exists between the player's 'currentSpeed' value and the manipulation of the game soundtrack's tempo. This 'currentSpeed' value, managed within the PlayMovement script, serves as the real-time input that drives the dynamic changes in music. The UpdateAudioTempo() function continuously monitors this value, providing the foundation for the tempo adjustments.

The core mechanism within this function revolves around the manipulation of the pitch property on the 'AudioSource' components attached to each music track. Whilst Unity's terminology refers to this parameter as "pitch," it's important to note that this adjustment simultaneously affects both the pitch and tempo of the audio. Essentially, Unity achieves this by modifying the playback sampling rate in real-time. This process offers a low computational cost and minimal sound distortion. To achieve our dynamic tempo effect in HarmonyScape, we utilise a linear mapping between the player's 'currentSpeed' and the pitch of all audio tracks within the game. This means that as the player's speed increases, the pitch of the music systematically increases as well, resulting in a corresponding increase in the perceived tempo. Conversely, as the player's speed decreases, the pitch is lowered, slowing down the tempo.

The original music composition for HarmonyScape took into account the intended dynamic tempo range. The tracks were designed to sound pleasing and natural even when the pitch is shifted to achieve the minimum and maximum tempos. Additionally, during testing, we carefully monitored for any potential audio artifacts at extreme tempos. Where necessary, subtle adjustments were made to the audio processing pipeline to ensure a smooth listening experience throughout the full tempo range.

The tempo range is governed by a formula within the UpdateAudioTempo() function:

\begin{align*}
tempo &= \text{Mathf.Lerp}(0.5f, 1.0f, smoothedSpeed / maxSpeed);
\end{align*}

In our implementation, 0.5f represents the minimum tempo (half the normal speed) and 1.0f represents the intended maximum tempo. This continuous adjustment of pitch, aligned with the player's movement, creates a system where the music feels intrinsically responsive to the player's actions, heightening the immersive experience.

\textbf{Smoothing Tempo Transitions}\newline
We utilise the 'Mathf.Lerp' function to interpolate pitch changes, ensuring smooth tempo transitions in the music. This prevents abrupt jumps that could disrupt the player's immersion. The 'Mathf.Lerp' function offers a computationally efficient way to smoothly adjust the audio source pitch, resulting in the corresponding change in tempo.

\textbf{Balancing Responsiveness with Smoothness}\newline
To balance the need for a responsive feel with the avoidance of jarring audio artifacts, we adjust the interpolation parameters within the 'Mathf.Lerp' function. Before calculating the tempo, we introduce a smoothing process to the player's 'currentSpeed'. This is achieved using the following code:

\begin{align*}
smoothedSpeed &= \text{Mathf.Lerp}(smoothedSpeed, currentSpeed, 0.8f * Time.deltaTime);
\end{align*}

This line of code smooths out minor fluctuations in the player's speed, preventing the music's tempo from mirroring every tiny movement change. We then use the 'smoothedSpeed' value to calculate the tempo. This approach ensures smooth tempo transitions while maintaining a responsive feel.

% \newpage

This chapter describes our evaluation of HarmonyScape, designed to answer the research questions from Chapter 1. We'll present experimental results and discuss how they address our questions and connect to existing research.

\section{Aims}
The overarching goal of the evaluation, as outlined in Chapter 1, seeks to determine if the HarmonyScape project effectively captivates users and potentially aids cognitive well-being within an enjoyable, interactive environment. Due to the complexity of this question, the evaluation will focus on a series of interrelated aims that contribute to answering this broader question:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Assess the game's intrinsic motivation potential. Does the multisensory design and interactive music system successfully promote player engagement?
    \item Evaluate how satisfying and enjoyable the dynamic music-making system is for players. Does it foster a sense of creative control within the game experience?
    \item Explore whether the game exhibits potential for aiding cognitive well-being in individuals living with dementia.
    \item Examine whether the game could induce any negative effects, such as stress or confusion, particularly for players with dementia.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Design}
The evaluation of the HarmonyScape project employed an approach that prioritised the collection of qualitative data centred on user experience. Given the target audience, the evaluation included caregivers and family members who had experience with individuals living with dementia or related conditions.

The decision to focus on caregivers and family members, rather than directly testing on individuals with dementia, was guided by several factors. Ethical considerations were an important factor, recognising the potential for people with dementia to have difficulty understanding the study's purpose or providing informed consent. Practical challenges related to potential unfamiliarity with technology and sustained focus could have presented limitations in gathering consistent feedback from participants with dementia. Additionally, due to limited resources of a student project, it would have proven difficult to recruit a sufficient number of participants with dementia.

Caregivers and family members of those with dementia possess a deep understanding of the capabilities, needs, and challenges of those living with dementia. Their participation allowed us to gain valuable insights into how the intended target audience might interact with and experience the game.

These insights provide a strong foundation for future research that directly evaluates the impact of HarmonyScape on individuals living with dementia. However, to directly assess the impact of HarmonyScape on individuals with dementia, future studies should be conducted in collaboration with specialist care facilities or dementia research organisations. Such future studies must prioritise ethical considerations and adhere to appropriate approval procedures.

\subsection{Pre-Study Survey}
Before interacting with HarmonyScape, participants were asked to complete a short survey. This survey collected basic demographic information, including age range, gender identity, and their experience with individuals living with intellectual disabilities related to dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease.

The purpose of this demographic data was to understand how representative the participant sample is and to help contextualise their feedback.

Additionally, participants were asked about their gaming experience. This aimed to establish their familiarity with video games and similar interactive experiences, providing insight into how their previous gaming habits might influence their interaction with HarmonyScape.

\subsection{Gameplay Evaluation}
% We chose to utilise the think-aloud protocol for its qualitative insights into the user experience. This method involves asking participants to verbalise their thoughts, feelings, and actions as they interact with the game. The approach provides valuable real-time insights into their thought processes, decision-making, and potential points of confusion or enjoyment (Hoonhout, 2022).

% The think-aloud method can be particularly valuable when evaluating systems designed for individuals with dementia.  While the current study did not include participants with dementia, their caregivers and professionals have deep insights into the challenges dementia can pose.  The protocol encourages immediate externalisation of thoughts, potentially revealing design aspects that might be difficult for someone with dementia to articulate (Papachristou et al., 2016). Additionally, it facilitates the identification of specific design elements that could present challenges for individuals with dementia (Papachristou et al., 2016).

% Clear instructions were provided to participants to collect all the game's instruments. These instructions, combined with the visual cues and guidance within the game itself, were designed to enable participants to complete the game independently and without intervention. Actual instructions on the key-mapping of the controls of the game, as discussed previously, was also given to ensure that there was no need for intervention. With their experience working with individuals living with dementia, participants were encouraged to consider and comment on any design aspects that could potentially aid or hinder the user experience for the target audience.

To gain valuable insights into the potential user experience of HarmonyScape, we sought feedback from caregivers and professionals with extensive experience working with individuals living with dementia. While this study did not directly involve participants with dementia, these individuals possess a deep understanding of the unique challenges presented by the condition. By analysing their insights, we aimed to identify design elements that may be particularly beneficial or challenging for individuals with dementia.

Participants were given clear instructions to collect all instruments within the game. These instructions, along with visual cues and guidance built into HarmonyScape, were designed to enable participants to complete the game independently and without intervention. Actual instructions on the key-mapping of the controls of the game, as discussed previously, are also included in the game itself to ensure that there was no need for intervention. Participants were encouraged to evaluate any design aspects that might impact the overall experience for someone with dementia.

\subsection{Post-Study Interview}
After completing HarmonyScape by collecting all the instruments and reaching the end-screen, participants engaged in a semi-structured interview. This interview aimed to gather qualitative insights into their experience across several key areas.  The first section of the interview was completed by everyone, while a second section was specifically designed for participants who had experience with individuals living with dementia.

\subsubsection{Post-Interview Questions:}
The first section of the interview comprised six subsections. 

The first subsection focused on gathering general impressions of the game, including its visual appeal, overall engagement, and the participant's initial reactions.  %This establishes a baseline of the participant's subjective enjoyment of the game.

The second subsection explored goal clarity and navigation, with questions designed to evaluate how clear the game's objectives appeared, the ease of understanding in-game progress, and whether the game environment posed any disorientation challenges.  Understanding these elements is crucial for assessing usability,  particularly for users who may experience cognitive challenges.  

The third subsection asked participants to assess their levels of stress and anxiety while playing, as these factors can significantly impact user experience. This is especially important for those with dementia, where heightened stress or confusion could be detrimental.

The fourth subsection focused on the musical experience. Participants were asked to evaluate the pleasantness of the dynamic soundtrack, its potential for intrinsic motivation, and suggestions for further enhancement. As the soundtrack is a central feature of the game, it's crucial to assess its effectiveness and potential  for enjoyment.  

The fifth subsection explores their understanding of the condition and their assessment of potential barriers that individuals with dementia might encounter while playing the game. This feedback is valuable in evaluating the game's suitability for the intended target audience.  

Finally, an open-ended section allowed participants to share any additional thoughts or observations, providing space for insights or concerns that might extend beyond the structured questions.

\subsubsection{Dementia Specific Questions:}
The second section of the interview focused specifically on participants with experience with individuals living with dementia. 

Questions in this section aimed to gather their insights about the potential suitability of HarmonyScape for those with dementia. One area explored the potential challenges or advantages of the game's interface, including whether a traditional computer setup might pose barriers, and if a tablet interface could be more accessible. Participants were also asked to evaluate the ease of navigation within the game environment and how clear the goal tracking might be for individuals with dementia.  Finally, questions focused on how the game's design could impact stress and anxiety levels, an important consideration when designing experiences for those with dementia.

\subsection{Limitations}
While the design of this evaluation provided valuable insights into HarmonyScape's potential, it's important to acknowledge certain limitations. 

The study relied primarily on participants with experience working with individuals with dementia, rather than those directly living with the condition. Additionally, some participants had no prior experience with individuals with dementia. While all perspectives are valuable, direct observation of individuals with dementia, along with their feedback, is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation. Future studies should prioritise collaboration with specialist care facilities or dementia research organisations to ensure the inclusion of individuals with dementia, taking into account ethical considerations and appropriate approval processes.

In addition to this, the study relied on a convenience sample consisting primarily of computing science students, friends, and family. This resulted in a limited demographic profile, particularly in terms of age range, technical experience, and crucially, experience with individuals living with dementia or related conditions. While the scope and time frame of a student project limited the ability to recruit a participant pool exclusively composed of those with dementia care experience, future studies should ensure all participants possess this background to provide more targeted insights relevant to the game's intended audience.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Pre-Survey Results}
A total of 11 participants were recruited through a convenience sampling method.  The age distribution skewed slightly younger, with six participants falling within the 25-34 age range and the remaining five within the 18-24 range, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:age_representation}. The sample had a near-equal gender balance, with six participants identifying as female and five identifying as male (See Figure \ref{fig:gender_representation}).

  \label{fig:participant_demographics} 
\end{figure}

Regarding experience with individuals living with dementia-related conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, the majority of participants possessed some knowledge or background (see Figure \ref{fig:dementia_experience}). Four participants indicated having some experience, while two reported extensive experience in this area. The remaining 5 having little-to-none.

The sample also exhibited a range of gaming experience levels (see Figure \ref{fig:gaming_experience}). Five participants identified as beginners, four reported advanced gaming skills, and two classified themselves as intermediate.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Post-Study Interview Results}
Participant interviews were transcribed for analysis. We employed an open and axial coding approach, inspired by the methodology of Corbin and Strauss (1990).  Each segment of the transcripts was assigned codes, which were then iteratively grouped to identify broader patterns and themes. Due to the volume of unique themes that emerged, the subsequent discussion focuses on those deemed most aligned to the research questions. To protect participant confidentiality, each interviewee was assigned a unique ID number. Quotations within the analysis will reference these identifiers to maintain anonymity.
\newline

\textbf{Camera Movement Concerns}

Another theme that emerged from the feedback was the potential for the camera movement system to cause confusion or disorientation for players. Participant 2 noted, \emph{“The only thing I would tweak about the game is the camera movement. The game character moving with the mouse movements can at times be confusing”}. This sentiment was echoed by Participant 9, who specifically mentioned difficulty with inverted camera controls. Other participants expanded on this issue, highlighting challenges with navigating uneven terrain or experiencing unintentional perspective shifts, as described by Participant 4, \emph{“I found the camera movements to be very disorienting and sometimes exiting/entering the mini-games was disorienting too because the perspective changed and sometimes unintentionally, like leaving the game accidentally”}. Participant 10 reinforced the concern, stating, \emph{“I think the only thing that may stress them [individuals with dementia] is the camera movement as it can be hard to get used to”}. The feedback highlights a crucial area for refinement. 

Optimising the camera controls and transitions is essential to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience, particularly for individuals with dementia who might be more susceptible to disorientation.
\newline

\textbf{Clarity of Instructions}

While participants found the minigames themselves engaging, a recurring theme was the desire for more comprehensive instructions and guidance. Participants 1, 5, and 10 expressed a need for clearer directions within the minigames, outlining the specific actions required to complete them. Participant 9 suggested incorporating constant reminders for interactions, potentially benefiting individuals with dementia. Participant 5 proposed that adding text-based instructions within the user interface (UI), outside of the Follow The Sound minigame which has this, could offer further assistance for those with dementia. 

Enhancing the clarity of instructions, both visually and through supplementary cues, seems crucial for maximising the accessibility and ease of use for individuals with varying levels of cognitive impairment.
\newline

\textbf{Instrument Symbol Visibility and Clarity}

Participants generally found the instrument icons, representing game progress, to be helpful and intuitive. Comments such as \emph{“super easy to understand”} (Participant 2) and \emph{“easy to understand”} (Participant 3) showcase this positive reception. Additionally, Participant 4 appreciated the multi-sensory feedback, with both visual cues (icons filling with colour) and auditory cues (instruments playing) reinforcing progress. However, some participants (5 and 6) suggested making the symbols larger or more prominent, as they initially went unnoticed. Participant 8 proposed additional celebratory visuals, such as confetti, to further emphasise successful instrument collection. 

While the core design of the progress symbols was well-received, there's room to enhance their visibility and impact. This could be achieved through increased size, bolder design, or the addition of supplemental visual cues to ensure all users, particularly those with potential cognitive challenges, clearly track their progress.
\newline

\textbf{Potential of Personalised Music}

Participant 2 expressed enthusiasm for the potential of incorporating a feature allowing users to add their own music to HarmonyScape. They envisioned this feature as a powerful tool for triggering positive memories and emotions in individuals with dementia. Specifically, they suggested that familiar music from a user's past could facilitate reminiscence and provide opportunities to connect with loved ones through shared experiences.

This feedback highlights the potential impact of personalised music choices within HarmonyScape and aligns with established reminiscence therapy techniques. Research demonstrates that familiar music can evoke positive memories and emotions in individuals with dementia, contributing to improved well-being (Bär \& Sunil 2014; Cuevas et al. 2020). Exploring the feasibility of such a feature could significantly enhance the therapeutic value of the game and create deeply meaningful experiences for individuals with dementia when playing through HarmonyScape.
\newline

\textbf{Musical Notes as Effective Guidance}

Participants found the visual representation of musical notes in the sky to be a helpful navigational aid. Participant 4 commented, \emph{“There were moments when I was unsure what to do, but then I noticed the clear instructions ... as the musical notes visible in the sky”}. Other participants echoed this positive response. Participant 1 noted, \emph{“The musical notes in the sky made it apparent where to go next”} and Participant 2 drew upon their experience with similar games, stating, \emph{“Based on my previous experiences with other open-world games, the icons in the sky help to work out what the next goals are and how to get to them”}.

The inclusion of musical notes as visual guides was well-received by participants and appears to be an effective way to provide directional cues within HarmonyScape's environment. This feature seems particularly valuable for users who may benefit from clear and intuitive navigational support.
\newline

\textbf{Navigational Challenges}

Despite the helpful musical notes, a common theme in the feedback was a sense of disorientation, with several participants expressing significant confusion about their location within the game world. Participant 7's comment, \emph{“But I was very lost”} highlights this sentiment. Other participants found the experience disorienting but enjoyable. Participant 11 describes this feeling, saying, \emph{“I was a little confused for a lot of it but it was still enjoyable”}. Participants noted that certain areas of the terrain, particularly the hills, lacked distinct visual landmarks, making it difficult to determine their position. 

Participants proposed various solutions to improve navigation. \emph{“Mini-map in the bottom of the screen or a full map upon pausing would make it easier to understand where you are in the world”}, suggests Participant 1. Others advocated for visual signposting of paths or an arrow pointing towards the next objective: \emph{“I think the paths without signposting may end up being confusing and frustrating... Using colours to help signpost when paths have been crossed will help the game become more simple”} (Participant 9).

The feedback strongly suggests that incorporating navigational aids is crucial for minimising frustration and confusion, particularly for users with dementia who might be more prone to disorientation, as displayed by Lin et al. (2002). Implementing one or more of the proposed solutions could significantly improve the user experience and ensure HarmonyScape remains an enjoyable and accessible experience for those with dementia. As discussed previously, studies have shown that these types of navigational aids can be particularly beneficial for individuals with dementia (Boggio et al., 2011).
\newline

\textbf{Visually Appealing Environment}

Participants overwhelmingly found the visual design of HarmonyScape to be engaging and stimulating. They appreciated the variety of landscapes, with comments like \emph{“different seasons within the game”} (Participant 2) and \emph{“rocks, beaches, hills and snowy mountains grabbed my attention”} (Participant 4). The use of bright colours was also noted as a positive element (Participants 5 and 6).  Participant 9 specifically mentioned that \emph{“the variety in landscape made me want to explore”}, while Participant 10 praised the graphics and character design. Though less focused on exploration, Participant 11 still found the changing landscapes and weather visually interesting.

The feedback highlights the success of HarmonyScape's visual design in creating an appealing and immersive environment. The diverse landscapes and vibrant colours seem to encourage exploration and enhance the overall user experience.
\newline

\textbf{Strong Intrinsic Motivation}

Participants expressed a high level of intrinsic motivation within HarmonyScape. They found the minigames themselves to be fun and engaging, describing a sense of satisfaction upon completion: \emph{“Intrinsically motivating because the mini-games were engaging and interesting and you got satisfaction from successfully completing them”} (Participant 1). This intrinsic motivation was further fuelled by the desire to hear the complete song, as noted by Participant 3: \emph{“I find the music motivating to complete more minigames as I can only hear the song in parts so I want to hear the completed final song”}.

While the feedback was largely positive, Participant 9 suggested a way to further increase intrinsic motivation: \emph{“Perhaps varying the music when in the minigames would make it more intrinsic, for example, adding a cool track that reflects the environment the minigame is played at - beach-type track playing during the beach minigame, for example”}.

HarmonyScape appears to successfully foster intrinsic motivation through its minigames and the gradual reveal of the dynamic soundtrack. Exploring ways to further personalise the musical experience, as suggested, could potentially enhance this aspect even further.

\textbf{Dynamic Music}
\begin{figure}[h]

 \caption{Survey results on the pleasantness of music and sounds in a game.} 
 \label{fig:pleasentness} 
\end{figure}


\subsection{Dementia Specific Questions}

\textbf{Tablet Interface Preference}

A recurring theme in the post-interview responses was the suggestion that a tablet interface could significantly enhance usability for individuals with dementia. Participants with caregiving experience drew upon their observations to support this viewpoint. Participant 2 stated: \emph{“A tablet interface would enhance usability based on my experience. I have noticed people with intellectual disabilities that I have cared for have a much easier time navigating a tablet interface than a laptop/desktop”}. Participants 3, 4, and 10 echoed similar sentiments, noting that a tablet or touchscreen could be more intuitive and accessible. Participant 10 specifically mentioned, \emph{“Yes, most of the individuals I worked with, with dementia and Alzheimer's, used an iPad as it is minimal and easy to use”}. 

This strong preference suggests that incorporating a tablet interface into future iterations of HarmonyScape may significantly improve the user experience for individuals with dementia.
\newline

\textbf{Music's Potential for Cognitive Stimulation and Stress Reduction}

Participants highlighted the potential for HarmonyScape's dynamic music system to positively impact memory and reduce stress levels in individuals with dementia. Participant 3 suggested, \emph{“The music however may be a big help for them to remember where they are”}. Expanding on this, Participant 2 elaborated, \emph{“Music would reduce their stress and anxiety levels. People I know with Alzheimer's find music to be calming and they find it enjoyable to be interactive with music. Music seems to be something that they always understand and enjoy... those instincts remain intact even as their cognitive abilities degrade, and it is the same way with music, it still brings them joy even if they don't recognise it in the exact same way”}. This participant also noted the interactive music's potential for cognitive stimulation. Participant 4 reinforced these observations, commenting, \emph{“The music used is really easing to the mind so I think you hit the nail on the head”}. 

These insights suggest that HarmonyScape's musical element could offer therapeutic benefits for individuals with dementia, both as a calming influence and a potential cognitive stimulant.
