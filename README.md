As dementia's prevalence increases, innovative therapeutic approaches are needed. This project introduces HarmonyScape, a 3D exploration game for individuals with dementia that leverages active music therapy principles. Designed with the aim to promote creative control and cognitive stimulation, HarmonyScape links player movement to a dynamic soundscape, alongside a unique multisensory experience. The evaluation included caregivers and family members of those with dementia to evaluate HarmonyScape's potential for this audience. Overall, participants found HarmonyScape visually appealing, engaging, and saw potential in its dynamic music for cognitive stimulation. However, feedback highlighted several areas for improvement, including refined camera controls, clearer instructions, and enhanced navigation for easier use by individuals with dementia. Future work should prioritise direct evaluation with individuals with dementia, along with exploring personalised music options and a tablet interface to maximise HarmonyScape's accessibility and therapeutic potential.
