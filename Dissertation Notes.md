Dissertation Notes

Two main types of music therapy can be distinguished: receptive and active music therapy. Receptive music therapy consists of listening to music by the therapist who sings or selects recorded music for the recipients. In active music therapy, recipients are actively involved in the music-making by playing for instance on small instruments. The participants may be encouraged to participate in musical improvisation with instruments or voice, with dance, movement activities or singing. Music therapists need the skills of both musicians and therapists if they are to benefit demented people. Music therapists must be trained to select and apply musical parameters adequately, tailored to a patient's needs and goals.

Whereas cognitive functions decline during disease progression, receptivity to music may remain until the late phases of dementia (Adridge 1996)

Music therapy enables the recall of life experiences and the experience of emotions. Many important life events are accompanied by music. Most of the time these â€žmusical memories" are stored for a longer time than the ones from the same period that were not accompanied by music (Broersen 1995;Baird 2009)

Even in the latest stage of the disease, patients may remain responsive to music where other stimuli may no longer evoke a reaction (Norberg 1986).
